<p>This is a common error in HTML. But I will try my best to make it uncommon.</p> <p>The problem is that the <code>&lt;</code> and <code>&gt;</code> symbols are not escaped properly.  They should be replaced with their HTML entities, <code>&amp;lt;</code> and <code>&amp;gt;</code> respectively.</p> <p>In the following example, the less than symbol is not escaped, causing the browser to interpret it as the start of a tag instead of plain text. This can lead to unexpected layout issues or even a completely broken HTML structure.</p> <pre><code class="language-html">&lt;p&gt;This is less than &lt; symbol&lt;/p&gt;</code></pre>
